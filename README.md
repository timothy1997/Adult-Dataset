Neural Network Approach for Adult Income Classification 

This is my approach to the Adult Data Set, which can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
The goal is to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. I used a neural network to build the model; purely for learning reasons. I will be continuing to update this approach as I learn more.
